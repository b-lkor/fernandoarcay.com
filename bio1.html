							<h3><center>Fernando Arcay</center></h3>
							<p>Fernando  Arcay's business life has reached a new level of success with the opening of a  joint-business venture, Arcay Group LLC, which proves to be the culmination of  over 25 years of business experience spanning retail, restaurants, and several  continents.</p>
							<p>At the tender  age of 51, Mr. Arcay has amassed a history well beyond his years. A  Venezuela-native, he has lived a life of adventure and through trial-and-error  he has earned his success.</p>
							<p> His journey  truly began when he travelled to the US at age 17 to take English courses at a  school in Kansas City. Two years later he moved to Florida to attend an  aviation academy. He graduated and returned to Venezuela to achieve his first  dream: serve as a commercial pilot. However, nearly five years into the career,  his family urged him to go into a safer industry, following the death of a  family member in a plane accident.</p>
							<p> His father  benevolently offered him money to open a business; the decision would mark a  lifetime of fearlessness and instill a true sense of gratitude and humility in  Mr. Arcay. Without much ado, he opened a unisex retail store. The clothing was  made in-house by his tailor friends. They constructed a fashion line and began  selling. His first store was surprisingly popular and soon enough he opened a  second store.Â  In the midst of his  success in fashion retail, Mr. Arcay smelled a new venture on the horizon. He  reminisced on his college days in America, relishing his memories of coffee from  Dunkin Donuts. However, this being the 80&rsquo;s, there was no Dunkin Donuts in  Venezuela so Mr. Arcay decided to open one. The first Dunkin Donuts was a  tremendous hit and the location remains open until this day.</p>
