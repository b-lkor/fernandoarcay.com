							<h3 class="p5">Fernando Arcay</h3>
							<p><img src="images/fernando.jpg" alt="Fernando Arcay" width="269" height="300" class="IMG-lft">Fernando  Arcay's business life has reached a new level of success with the opening of a  joint-business venture, Arcay Group LLC, which proves to be the culmination of  over 25 years of business experience spanning retail, restaurants, and several  continents.</p>
							<p>							  At the tender  age of 51, Mr. Arcay has amassed a history well beyond his years. A  Venezuela-native, he has lived a life of adventure and through trial-and-error  he has earned his success.</p>
							<p> His journey  truly began when he travelled to the US at age 17 to take English courses at a  school in Kansas City. Two years later he moved to Florida to attend an  aviation academy. He graduated and returned to Venezuela to achieve his first  dream: serve as a commercial pilot. However, nearly five years into the career,  his family urged him to go into a safer industry, following the death of a  family member in a plane accident.</p>
							<p> His father  benevolently offered him money to open a business; the decision would mark a  lifetime of fearlessness and instill a true sense of gratitude and humility in  Mr. Arcay. Without much ado, he opened a unisex retail store. The clothing was  made in-house by his tailor friends. They constructed a fashion line and began  selling. His first store was surprisingly popular and soon enough he opened a  second store.  In the midst of his  success in fashion retail, Mr. Arcay smelled a new venture on the horizon. He  reminisced on his college days in America, relishing his memories of coffee from  Dunkin Donuts. However, this being the 80&rsquo;s, there was no Dunkin Donuts in  Venezuela so Mr. Arcay decided to open one. The first Dunkin Donuts was a  tremendous hit and the location remains open until this day.</p>
							<p> His work  ethic has always been distinguishable. He worked night and day in his stores,  personally managing nearly every task. When his heart led him to a new venture,  he decided to sell his two flourishing retail stores as well as the Dunkin  Donuts in order to carefully oversee yet another soon-to-be-successful project.</p>
							<p> The  business-maven had been moved to open a discotheque—complete with a  restaurant—modeled after a club called Gammon&rsquo;s back in Kansas City. Mr. Arcay  enjoyed seeing how well his local community accepted American culture and the  sight had inspired him to bring more of his memories from the US to life in  Venezuela.</p>
							<p> The Club was  always busy, staying open almost 24 hours a day to accommodate all the  business. However, the road of life had different plans and Mr. Arcay ended up  selling the nightclub to follow his sister to New York, the city of  opportunities. Always one to keep an eye out for intelligent business  strategies, he realized there was a need for newer technology in Venezuela and  he became a buyer for them, exporting the most modern conveniences from the US.</p>
							<p> Mr. Arcay returned to  Venezuela in 1992. Remembered for his wonderful restaurant, he was sought after  to provide the menu for a well-known Country Club in Valencia. With fresh  inspiration to bring American culture to Venezuela, he began preparation to  open a restaurant called &ldquo;Kumba&rdquo;, inspired by the famous roller coaster ride  located in Busch Gardens, Tampa Florida.</p>
							<p> Mr. Arcay has always been  loyal to his native country, but he found that he loved the US so much (even  opening a number of businesses inspired by the US), he decided to settle in  South Florida. In 1996, he opened Neighbourhood Food, a food factory  manufacturing traditional Venezuelan favorites, his first attempt to bring his  native culture to the US. In 1998 he switched his focus from manufacturing goods  to creating special occasions and opened Arcay Catering, handling special  events and all of the catering for Fonovideo, a Spanish film company.  As per the tone of his life, the catering  company quickly grew and evolved, leading Mr. Arcay to open Fernando Arcay  Special Events in 1999 and land a contract with Telemundo.</p>
							<p> In 2007, Mr.  Arcay switched the focus of his company toward private events, saying goodbye  to the production sets. The retooled Fernando Arcay Special Events is his  current enterprise, thirteen -years strong and continuously expanding. In 2010,  the company was sought after to manage the hotel concessions at The Albion  Hotel on South Beach. The hotel owners had come to know Mr. Arcay from catering  the events at their museum. Mr. Arcay accepted the task and opened a hotels  division within his company. Soon after, more hotels began enlisting him; most  recently, Best Western Premier in Coral Gables.</p>
							<p> Instead of  closing the catering business and beginning yet another new venture, Mr.  Arcay's wisdom has shown him that a businessman does not have to manage every  detail of the business, inspiring him to hire on managers—personally trained by  him—for the separate divisions and operations of his company, allowing him to  oversee all affairs and continue to expand his vision.</p>
							<p> Mr Arcay is someone who  dedicates everything to his work and his businesses. Previously, he felt more  comfortable doing everything himself, but as his reach in the community has  grown, so has his staff. Arcay Group LLC is a culmination of a successful  business man's journey through the world of business, a journey that has added  a well-trained and professional staff, to continue an even larger purpose.</div>
