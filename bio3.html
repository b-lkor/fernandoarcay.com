							<p>In 1998 he switched his focus from manufacturing goods  to creating special occasions and opened Arcay Catering, handling special  events and all of the catering for Fonovideo, a Spanish film company.  As per the tone of his life, the catering  company quickly grew and evolved, leading Mr. Arcay to open Fernando Arcay  Special Events in 1999 and land a contract with Telemundo.</p>
                            <p>In 2007, Mr.  Arcay switched the focus of his company toward private events, saying goodbye  to the production sets. The retooled Fernando Arcay Special Events is his  current enterprise, thirteen -years strong and continuously expanding. In 2010,  the company was sought after to manage the hotel concessions at The Albion  Hotel on South Beach. The hotel owners had come to know Mr. Arcay from catering  the events at their museum. Mr. Arcay accepted the task and opened a hotels  division within his company. Soon after, more hotels began enlisting him; most  recently, Best Western Premier in Coral Gables.</p>
<p> Instead of  closing the catering business and beginning yet another new venture, Mr.  Arcay's wisdom has shown him that a businessman does not have to manage every  detail of the business, inspiring him to hire on managers—personally trained by  him—for the separate divisions and operations of his company, allowing him to  oversee all affairs and continue to expand his vision.</p>
<p> Mr Arcay is someone who  dedicates everything to his work and his businesses. Previously, he felt more  comfortable doing everything himself, but as his reach in the community has  grown, so has his staff. Arcay Group LLC is a culmination of a successful  business man's journey through the world of business, a journey that has added  a well-trained and professional staff, to continue an even larger purpose.</p>
