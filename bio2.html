							<p>His work  ethic has always been distinguishable. He worked night and day in his stores,  personally managing nearly every task. When his heart led him to a new venture,  he decided to sell his two flourishing retail stores as well as the Dunkin  Donuts in order to carefully oversee yet another soon-to-be-successful project.
</p>
<p>The  business-maven had been moved to open a discotheque—complete with a  restaurant—modeled after a club called Gammon&rsquo;s back in Kansas City. Mr. Arcay  enjoyed seeing how well his local community accepted American culture and the  sight had inspired him to bring more of his memories from the US to life in  Venezuela.</p>
                            <p> The Club was  always busy, staying open almost 24 hours a day to accommodate all the  business. However, the road of life had different plans and Mr. Arcay ended up  selling the nightclub to follow his sister to New York, the city of  opportunities. Always one to keep an eye out for intelligent business  strategies, he realized there was a need for newer technology in Venezuela and  he became a buyer for them, exporting the most modern conveniences from the US.</p>
                            <p> Mr. Arcay returned to  Venezuela in 1992. Remembered for his wonderful restaurant, he was sought after  to provide the menu for a well-known Country Club in Valencia. With fresh  inspiration to bring American culture to Venezuela, he began preparation to  open a restaurant called &ldquo;Kumba&rdquo;, inspired by the famous roller coaster ride  located in Busch Gardens, Tampa Florida.</p>
<p> Mr. Arcay has always been  loyal to his native country, but he found that he loved the US so much (even  opening a number of businesses inspired by the US), he decided to settle in  South Florida. In 1996, he opened Neighbourhood Food, a food factory  manufacturing traditional Venezuelan favorites, his first attempt to bring his  native culture to the US. </p>
